          <h1><b>Decisions</b></h1>
          <p>Catalyna decided to go home and not disobey her mom.<p>
          <p>This caused her mom to trust her and know that she is caplable of making responsible descions on her own.<p>
          <p>She talked to Catalyna about why she didn't want her to go and of all the risks that come along with going out.<p>
          <p>Catalyna then told her mom that in order for her to learn and grow she had to be able to make her own mistakes.<p>
          <p>Her mom agreed with everything Catalyna was saying and they came up with a compromise that worked for both of them.<p>
          <p>Catalyna was able to go out with her friends as long as she told her mom where she was going and would be hoe by curfew.<p>
          <p>And if she decided to stay the night she would let her mom know before going out.<p>
