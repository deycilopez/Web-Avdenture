          <p>In the bible it says one must forgive in order to be forgiven oneself.<p>
          <p>Catalyna's did indeed forgive her and taught her the value of lying and how the truth always comes forth.<p>
          <p>Catalyna and her mom were able to come up with an agreement of how to to go about the problem and how they could both come up with a compromise. <p>
          <p>Catalyna's mo agreed to let her go out as long as she would alwasy slet her mom know where she would be at, she could not drive if she was dirnking and if she was to drink<p>
          <p>she could stay the night at her friends house.<p>
          <p>This taught Catalyna a valuable lesson. Not only was she given more freedom but she was able to be more open with her mom, giving them a close bond that she will always treasure.<p>
